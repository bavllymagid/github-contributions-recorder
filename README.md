# Github Contributions Recorder

The GitHub Contributions Recorder is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers track their GitHub commit activity and log it directly to a GitHub repository. This extension automates the process of collecting commit data from a local Git repository, appending the information to a log file, and pushing it to a GitHub repository for tracking and archiving. It integrates seamlessly with Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code to provide a smooth workflow for tracking daily progress and bypasses the fact that your GitHub contributions grid looks bad because you're working on branches not the main branch.

## Features

- Automatic Commit Logging: Automatically track and log your commits to a specified log file.
- Branch Tracking: Record contributions from all branches, not just the main branch.
